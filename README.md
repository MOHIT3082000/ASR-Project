# ASR-Project
ASR System Automatic Speech Recognition system that transcribes spoken language into text. Records audio, recognizes speech, and generates text output. Built with Python and supports customizable recording duration.
Project Title: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System

Project Description:

This project is an implementation of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, designed to transcribe spoken language into text. The system utilizes a machine learning approach to recognize patterns in audio inputs and generate corresponding text outputs.

Key Features:

Audio Recording: The system can record audio inputs from a user's device for a specified duration (e.g., 10 seconds).
Speech Recognition: The recorded audio is then processed using a speech recognition algorithm to identify spoken words and phrases.
Text Transcription: The recognized speech is transcribed into text, which can be displayed or stored for further processing.
Technical Details:

Programming Language: Python
Dependencies: [list dependencies, e.g., speech_recognition, pyaudio, etc.]
Audio Input: Supports recording from device's microphone
Audio Format: [ specify audio format, e.g., WAV, MP3, etc.]
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the project using python local_asr.py --duration 10 (replace 10 with desired recording duration).
Example Use Cases:

Voice-controlled applications
Speech-to-text systems
Audio transcription services
Future Development:

Improving speech recognition accuracy
Supporting additional audio formats
Integrating with other natural language processing (NLP) tools
